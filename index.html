    <h2>Definition:</h2>
    
    <em>Green architecture</em> is a design philosophy aimed at minimizing the negative impact of buildings on the environment by using <strong> sustainable materials</strong> and <strong> energy efficient construction methods.</strong> This approach not only focuses on reducing environmental harm but also prioritizes creating a healthy indoor environment for the building’s occupants.
    
    <h2>Origines</h2>
    
  The idea of green architecture dates back to ancient civilizations. Without the advantages of modern technology, these societies had to harmonize with the natural environment to create livable structures. In the absence of air conditioning, buildings were designed for natural ventilation to regulate indoor climates, and their placement was carefully chosen to maximize natural light.
    
    Over time as technology progressed and urbanization increased there was a shift away from integrating with the land and towards prioritizing modern conveniences.
    
    Today, with sustainable living gaining traction, the principles of green design have become more prevalent in the fight against climate change. Buildings that achieve specific energy efficiency standards are awarded <strong>LEED certification</strong>, which stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, a globally recognized green building standard.
    
    <h2>Renewable Energy Sources</h2> 
    For homeowners interested in incorporating renewable energy into their residences, there are several effective options to consider:

    <ol>
   <li><strong>Green Roofs:</strong>  Also known as living roofs, these feature vegetation that can cover part or all of the roof. Green roofs enhance air quality, provide additional insulation, and help manage stormwater runoff.</li>
   <li><strong>Solar Panels:</strong> These panels, equipped with solar cells, convert sunlight into electricity. Installing solar panels can enable you to power your home with renewable energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Geothermal Systems:</strong> These systems harness the natural heat stored beneath the Earth’s surface. They are an excellent alternative to traditional HVAC systems, as they can significantly lower both energy consumption and costs.</li>
</ol> 

    <p><em>Reducing energy</em> usage is a central aim of green architecture, so it is common for such buildings to incorporate renewable <strong>energy sources</strong> as part of their design.</p>
