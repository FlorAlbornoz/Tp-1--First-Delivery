   <h1>Sustainable materials</h1> 
Substitute harmful, synthetic materials in products with sustainable alternatives that are natural, renewable, carbon-neutral, and require less energy for extraction. For instance:
<h2>Natural</h2>
<p>Synthetic materials often contain toxic or hazardous substances and may not biodegrade, leading to environmental accumulation. Consider replacing plastics with wood and synthetic fabrics with hemp or organic cotton canvas.</p>
<h2>Renewable</h2>
<p>While some natural materials are renewable, not all are. Materials like iron and aluminum, though non-renewable, can be recycled indefinitely. However, elements like rare earth metals, lead, antimony, zinc, and silver are limited in supply, and their extraction is energy-intensive and environmentally damaging.</p>
<h2>Non-toxic and Harmless</h2>
<p>The production process is equally important. Avoid materials produced with harmful chemicals. Understand the full lifecycle of the materials you use to ensure they are produced in environmentally friendly and non-toxic ways.</p>


<h3>Use of Sustainable and Recycled Materials</h3>

<p>Green design emphasizes environmental responsibility from the very beginning of a construction project. Green architects prioritize the use of non-toxic, recycled, and sustainable building materials. Commonly used materials in green architecture include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reclaimed Wood</li>
<li>Bamboo</li>
<li>Cork</li>
<li>Wool</li>
<li>Linen</li>
<li>Straw</li>
<li>Clay</li>
<li>Stone</li>
<li>Sand</li> 
<li>Beeswax</li>
<li>Coconut</li>
<li>Hempcrete</li>
<li>Straw Bales</li>
<li>Clay Plaster</li>
<li>Sheepâ€™s Wool</li>
<li>Enviroboard</li>
</ul>


Incorporating these materials helps to <strong>reduce the environmental impact of building projects</strong>  and promotes sustainability throughout the construction process.
